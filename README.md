# Deep Genomic Signature (DGS)
This repository is created for some codes, files, and supplementary materials for Deep Genomic Signature for early metastasis prediction in prostate cancer. 
I Provided some Python and R codes that I used in this project. Python codes are based on TensorFlow for Denoising Auto-Encoder (DAE). R codes are for extraction of genes with high weights from the learned and transferred weight matrices in the implemented DAEs. 
We also uploaded Supplementary Materials including Supplementary Tables, mentioned in the original paper here in the .xlsx file.
